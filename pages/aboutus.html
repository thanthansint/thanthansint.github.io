                        ‘wow’ flavour, experience and consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming

                        We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When
                        we’re not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients,
                        we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic
                        Canadians to crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.</p>

                        After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland
                        learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in
                        2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in
                        the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.

                    <p class="tab"> 
                        Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma
                        tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni,
                        salami from albella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about
                        eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.
